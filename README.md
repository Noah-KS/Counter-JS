# React and JavaScript Projects

## Overview
This contains a series of small projects as part of my warm up back to programming after my exchange studies. 
Each project is too small to have its own repo so I will compile them all in here. 
Some projects are even combinations of smaller projects. 

I am doing this by attending online courses, which are listed below.

## Objective
To refresh my technical skills and knowledge through projects. Difficulty will gradually ramp up, with the end goal for this repo being to contain small practice projects before I delve into more complex ones.

## Online Courses Attended
The projects are based on the online courses I attended below. For some projects in this repo, I combined projects taught from the lectures as some were too basic on their own.

[20 hands-on projects in React and JavaScript by K.Sathyaprakash Reddy](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-20-hands-on-projects-in-react-and-javascript) Provides a basic overview of React and Javascript via development of basic applications.

[30+ React Projects, Learn React JS by Building 30+ Web Apps by Norbert B. Menyhart](https://www.udemy.com/course/30-react-projects-learn-react-js-by-building-30-web-apps) Covers a range of topics including React routing, styled components, and data processing with local and server-based databases. Focuses on functional components and essential React Hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef, and useContext. 


## Notes
The projects with 2 numbers (ex: 1 & 2) means it was created twice, once in JS and once in React. This was to practice with and without the help of a framework.

***The REACT version is ALWAYS better with more functionalities, better visuals, etc. Thus, the description for each project describes the REACT version.***
