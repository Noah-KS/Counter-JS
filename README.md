# React and JavaScript Projects

## Overview
This contains a series of projects as part of my warm up back to programming after my exchange semester in Korea.
I am doing this by emulating the projects seen in the [Udemy course: Build 20 hands-on projects in React and JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-20-hands-on-projects-in-react-and-javascript/#reviews). 
Each project is aimed at demonstrating practical applications of React and JavaScript in web development.

## Objective
To revitalize my technical skills and knowledge through practical projects. In this case, a basic overview in React and Javascript to rebuild my foundation before going into more complex projects.

## Projects
### 1. JavaScript Counter (Current Project)
- **Description**: A simple counter application using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to increment, decrement, and reset a numerical value.
