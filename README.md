# React and JavaScript Projects

## Overview
A series of small projects to warm up back to programming after my exchange studies. 

I am doing this by attending online courses, which are listed below.

Most projects are zcombinations of smaller projects presented within the lectures.

## Objective
To refresh my technical skills and knowledge through practical application. Difficulty will gradually ramp up before I delve into more complex work.

## Online Courses Attended
The projects are based on the online courses I attended below. 

As some lecture projects were very basic, the projects I created based on these courses were often combined from **multiple** lessons.

[30+ React Projects, Learn React JS by Building 30+ Web Apps by Norbert B. Menyhart](https://www.udemy.com/course/30-react-projects-learn-react-js-by-building-30-web-apps) 
Covers react routing, styled components, and data processing with local and server-based databases. Focuses on functional components and essential React Hooks like useState, useEffect, useRef, and useContext. 

## Notes
The projects with 2 numbers (ex: 1 & 2) means I created it twice, once in JS and once in React. This was to practice with and without the help of a framework.

***The REACT version is ALWAYS better with more functionalities, better visuals, etc. Thus, the description for each project describes the REACT version.***
