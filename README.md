# React and JavaScript Projects

## Overview
This contains a series of projects as part of my warm up back to programming after my exchange semester in Korea.
I am doing this by emulating the projects seen in the [Udemy course: Build 20 hands-on projects in React and JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-20-hands-on-projects-in-react-and-javascript/#reviews), which should provide practical applications (albeit basic) of React and JavaScript in web development.

## Objective
To refresh my technical skills and knowledge through simple practical projects. In this case, a basic overview in React and Javascript to rebuild my foundations before going into more complex projects.

## Projects
### âœ… 1. Counter in Javascript 
- **Description**: A simple counter application using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to increment, decrement, and reset a numerical value with a sleek UI.

### âœ… 2. Counter in React
- **Description**: The same counter application but this time leveraging the power of React, with a focus on React fundamentals like components, state management, event handling, and JSX to build a web application.

### âœ… 3. Calculator in Javascript
- **Description**: A classic calculator application that combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is capable of performing both basic arithmetic and more complex equations involving as many operators as you want, adhering to the order of operations (ex: 3 * 4 + 51 / 3 - 3).
