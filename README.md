# React and JavaScript Projects

## Overview
This contains a series of projects as part of my warm up back to programming after my exchange semester in Korea.
I am doing this by emulating the projects seen in the [Udemy course: Build 20 hands-on projects in React and JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-20-hands-on-projects-in-react-and-javascript/#reviews), which should provide practical applications (albeit basic) of React and JavaScript in web development.

## Objective
To refresh my technical skills and knowledge through simple practical projects. In this case, a basic overview in React and Javascript to rebuild my foundations before going into more complex projects.

## Projects
### ✅ 1. Counter in Javascript 
- **Description**: A simple counter application using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to increment, decrement, and reset a numerical value with a sleek UI.

### ✅ 2. Counter in React
- **Description**: The same counter application, but this time leveraging the power of React, with a focus on React fundamentals like components, state, and props, and how they interact to build dynamic web applications.
