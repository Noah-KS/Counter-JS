# React and JavaScript Projects

## Overview
This contains a series of small projects as part of my warm up back to programming after my exchange semester in Korea, where I persued other topics like Business and Economics to gain a greater global perspective and broaden my understanding of other sectors. Each project is too small to have its own repo so I will compile them all in here.

I am doing this by attending online courses, all of which are listed below.

## Objective
To refresh my technical skills and knowledge through practical projects. Each project will gradually ramp up in difficulty, but the end goal is for this repository to contain projects I created out of practice to test my foundations before I delve into more complex projects in other repositories.

## Online Courses Attended
In the pursuit of enhancing my technical skills, I have attended several online courses on React and JavaScript. The list below is a summary of the courses I have attended.
