# React and JavaScript Projects

## Overview
This contains a series of small projects as part of my warm up back to programming after my exchange studies. 
Each project is too small to have its own repo so I will compile them all in here. 
Some projects are even combinations of smaller projects. 

I am doing this by attending online courses, which are listed below.

## Objective
To refresh my technical skills and knowledge through projects. Difficulty will gradually ramp up, with the end goal for this repo being to contain small practice projects before I delve into more complex ones.

## Online Courses Attended
The projects are based on the online courses I attended below. For some projects in this repo, I combined projects taught from the lectures as some were too basic on their own.
